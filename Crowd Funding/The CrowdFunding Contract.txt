1)The Admin will start a campaign for CrowdFunding with a specific monetary goal and
deadline.
2) Contributors will contribute to that project by sending ETH.
3) The admin has to create a Spending Request to spend money for the campaign.
4) Once the spending request was created, the Contributors can start voting for that
specific Spending Request.
5) If more than 50% of the total contributors voted for that request, then the admin would
have the permission to spend the amount specified in the spending request.
6) The power is moved from the campaignâ€™s admin to those that donated money.
7) The contributors can request a refund if the monetary goal was not reached within the
deadline.
